# Eviscerate The Synth
*i'll get a logo for this dingus someday, i swear*\
Discord bot I'm developing as a long term "get good at problem solving and golang" project

#### *Setup*
i'll.. write this eventually. at the time of writing this readme (december 17th, 7pm) i just got done with three hours spent debugging two damn lines of code and i am *very* tired

#### *Will there be a public version of this bot?*
Probably not, at least not for the forseeable future. This is currently a passion project and not something I intend for to become the next big "thing".

#### *Can I watch you develop it, at least?*
Yes! I'll usually be in my [Discord server](https://discord.gg/SJcAWEynbj) streaming it, and sometimes on [Twitch](https://twitch.tv/aegiscarr).\
My Discord has a channel dedicated to me ranting about it too.

#### *This wouldn't have been the same without:*
- [Deepfried Chips](https://github.com/Deepfried-Chips) for helping me get this thing off the ground in the first place
- [Lucas Beyer](https://github.com/lucasb-eyer) for his library [Colorful](https://github.com/lucasb-eyer/go-colorful)
- [bwmarrin](https://github.com/bwmarrin) for making [DiscordGo](https://github.com/bwmarrin/discordgo) and by extension making this entire thing possible.
